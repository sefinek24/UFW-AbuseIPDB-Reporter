# 🛡️ UFW AbuseIPDB Reporter
A utility designed to analyze UFW firewall logs and report malicious IP addresses to the [AbuseIPDB](https://www.abuseipdb.com) database.  
To prevent redundant reporting of the same IP address within a short period, the tool uses a temporary cache file to track previously reported IPs.

If you like this repository or find it useful, I would greatly appreciate it if you could give it a star ⭐. Thanks a lot!

## 📋 Requirements
- [Node.js + npm](https://nodejs.org)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com)


## 📥 Installation

cd ~
git clone https://github.com/sefinek/UFW-AbuseIPDB-Reporter.git

## 🖥️ Usage
After successful installation, the script will run continuously in the background, monitoring UFW logs and automatically reporting malicious IP addresses.
The tool requires no additional user action after installation. However, it's worth occasionally checking its operation and updating the script regularly (by running the installation command).

Servers open to the world are constantly scanned by bots, usually looking for vulnerabilities or other security gaps.
So don't be surprised if the next day, the number of reports to AbuseIPDB exceeds a thousand.

### 🔍 Checking logs
```bash
pm2 logs ufw-abuseipdb
```

### 📄 Example report
